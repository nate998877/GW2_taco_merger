IMPORTANT
*********
You should NEVER overwrite the GW2 TacO ReActif files with the official version 
files because even if "GW2TacO.exe" is identical, the files such as translations, 
timers, interface (CSS, WBS) are different.


UPDATE
******
For ZIP or External Pack versions, you just need to replace all the files by those 
of the new version (be careful not to just add to the files present as this will 
not erase the files that were removed)

It is therefore advisable to remove the files manually before decompressing the ZIP.

If you want to keep your validated parameters and markers or added external packs.
Take care not to overwrite or erase the named files:
- TacOConfig.xml
- activationdata.xml
- External packs (.taco or .zip)


GW2 TACO ICON LOCATION
**********************
The GW2 TacO icon is located to the right of the Guild Wars 2 icons (default).
In the past, this icon was located at the left end of the screen under Guild Wars 
2 settings icon.

This was to make the display of the submenus more accessible and to avoid 
annoying overlaps but I have been warned that this is causing a compatibility 
with another tool named "Blish HUB" and to avoid this, the icon of GW2 TacO will 
now be set to its default location.

It is possible if you do not use this other tool to modify yourself the location 
of the GW2 TacO icon in order to return it to the left end.

To do this, you will find in a folder named "Patches" two ZIP archives:
- Default_TacO_Icon_Location.zip   (following the game icons)
- Alternate_TacO_Icon_Location.zip (at the left end under the Settings icon)

You just need to replace the .CSS files located in the GW2 TacO folder by those 
of the archive that interests you to choose the location of the GW2 TacO.


Good game !
